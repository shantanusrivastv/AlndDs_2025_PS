# Source Code Reference Notes

This document contains two main versions of the code:  

- **Final**  
- **Incremental-Final**  

Both are valuable for learning and practice, but their purposes differ slightly.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Final

- Contains the **final code** the author used.  
- Represents the **optimal solution**.  
- Implements **DST (Data Structure & Trees)** directly in its most efficient form.  

Use this version when you want to study the clean, **production-quality solution** without intermediate steps.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Incremental-Final

- Also contains the **final code**, but built **incrementally**.  
- Uses all the **previous examples with LinkedList** instead of directly jumping into BST.  
- Adds **extra checks** and **defensive coding practices** that may not be present in the pure final version.  
- Sometimes includes:  
  - Test cases  
  - Additional validation logic  
  - Experimental coding practices around DST  

This version is particularly useful as a **learning path**, since it demonstrates the evolution of the solution and introduces extra defensive coding concepts.

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendation

- **Start with the Incremental-Final** version:  
  - Easier to follow.  
  - Contains more checks, tests, and learning-oriented improvements.  

- Then, move on to the **Final** version:  
  - Cleaner and more optimal.  
  - Better for real-world usage once concepts are fully understood.

## âœ… Personal Practice

Iâ€™ve also added some of my own **DST coding practice snippets** alongside the authorâ€™s versions, which may differ slightly but are meant to enhance understanding.
